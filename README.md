## Git Workflow

This project follows a structured branching strategy designed for scalable development and reliable releases.

### Branch Structure

#### Main Branch (`main`)
The `main` branch contains the most up-to-date, production-ready code. All release branches are created from this branch, and it serves as the single source of truth for the application's current state.

#### Release Branches (`x.y.z`)
Release branches follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) specification:
- **Format**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.0.0`, `1.2.3`, `2.0.0`)
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes that are not backward compatible
- **MINOR**: New features that are backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes that are backward compatible

Release branches are created directly from `main` and represent stable versions of the application.

#### Development Branch (`develop`)
The `develop` branch is the integration branch where all feature development converges. It contains the latest development changes and serves as the staging area before merging into `main`.

**Important**: The `develop` branch must always be rebased from the latest version branch to maintain a clean history and incorporate the most recent stable changes.

#### Feature Branches
All development work is done in feature branches that follow a strict naming convention:

**Pattern**: `^(feat|chore|bug|fix|doc|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|revert|)-[a-z]+(-[a-z]+)*$`

**Branch Types**:
- `feat-`: New features or functionality
- `chore-`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- `bug-`: Bug fixes and issue resolution
- `fix-`: General fixes and corrections
- `doc-`/`docs-`: Documentation updates
- `style-`: Code style, formatting changes
- `refactor-`: Code refactoring without functionality changes
- `perf-`: Performance improvements
- `test-`: Test additions or modifications
- `build-`: Build system or deployment changes
- `ci-`: Continuous integration configuration
- `revert-`: Reverting previous changes

**Examples**:
- `feat-user-authentication`
- `fix-api-response-validation`
- `chore-update-dependencies`
- `docs-git-workflow`

### Workflow Rules

1. **Feature Branch Creation**: All feature branches must be created from and regularly rebased against the `develop` branch
2. **Development Integration**: Feature branches are merged into `develop` via pull requests
3. **Release Preparation**: When `develop` is stable, it's merged into the latest release version, then merged into `main` for production release.
4. **Version Management**: Release branches are tagged and created from `main`
5. **Hotfixes**: Critical fixes can be branched directly from release branches and merged back to both `main` and `develop`

### Best Practices

- Keep feature branches focused on single features or fixes
- Rebase regularly to maintain clean commit history
- Use descriptive commit messages following conventional commit format
- Ensure all tests pass before merging
- Review code through pull requests before integration

## Development Environment Setup

This project uses .NET 9.0 and follows strict code formatting standards to ensure consistency across the codebase.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- IDE: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

### Code Formatting Configuration

The project includes comprehensive formatting configuration that works automatically with both VS Code and Rider:

#### Files Included:
- `.editorconfig` - Universal formatting rules for all editors
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code specific settings with auto-format on save
- `.vscode/extensions.json` - Recommended extensions for VS Code
- `.idea/codeStyles/` - Rider/IntelliJ code style configuration

#### VS Code Setup:
1. Install recommended extensions when prompted, or install manually:
   - `ms-dotnettools.csharp` - C# language support
   - `ms-dotnettools.csdevkit` - C# Dev Kit
   - `editorconfig.editorconfig` - EditorConfig support

2. Auto-formatting is enabled by default for:
   - Format on save
   - Format on type
   - Format on paste
   - Organize imports on save
   - Fix all auto-fixable issues on save

#### Rider Setup:
1. Rider will automatically detect and apply the project's code style settings
2. To enable format on save in Rider:
   - Go to **File > Settings > Tools > Actions on Save**
   - Enable **Reformat code** and **Optimize imports**

#### Manual Formatting:
```bash
# Format all C# files in the project
dotnet format

# Format specific file
dotnet format --include path/to/file.cs
```

### Code Style Standards

The project enforces:
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces
- **Line endings**: LF (Unix-style)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **Trailing whitespace**: Automatically trimmed
- **Final newline**: Automatically added
- **C# conventions**: Microsoft's recommended style guidelines
- **Braces**: Always required for control statements
- **Null checking**: Prefer pattern matching and null coalescing
